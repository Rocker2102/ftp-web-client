# FTP Client
Web app to browse ftp sites with a better UI/UX than the browser default.

Made using **PHP7** and **Materialize.css v.1.0** &copy; CSS3 framework.

_A HTTPS connection should be used to prevent password leakage while transferring sensitive links (downloading files)._

## Note 
_This web app <b>does not</b> create a <b>persistent connection</b> to the FTP server. A new connection (<b>new login/session</b>) is created before every operation (Unless you are viewing a cached or local copy of the results)._
